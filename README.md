### Promotion

- Area

![Promotion_area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mustela-sibirica/4-Way-Chess/master/pic/Promotion_area.png)

- Pawn

All pawns can move move laterally when the piece rasch 'Promotion Area' (green) once.

When a pawn (except Japanese Chess, which have special promotion rules) reach or across 'Reference points', or reach other player's 'Bottom line', it can promote to Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, or not.

!!!But the piece promoted to have to NOT EXIST in board now!!!

In Chinese chess, Queen promoted can move everywhere, which differ form normal one, I call it '升士'.

In Japanese Chess，pieces reach other player's 'Home Area', can promote as relus:

- Blocking

Two Eastern or two Western chess pieces can NOT hold in same block, eastern chess is Chinese chess and Japanses chess, western chess is chess and ancient India chess.

When a pieces can capture more than one piece after one move, pick one to capture.
